# React Tabs Project

This project demonstrates a simple React application that allows users to toggle between different companies and view respective job details, such as the position title, company name, job description, and duties.

## Project Overview

This React app fetches job information from an external API and displays the details based on the company selected by the user. The project includes:

- Fetching data from an API
- Displaying data in a tab-like format
- Dynamically updating content based on user input
- Usage of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing component state and side effects

## Step-by-Step Guide to Create This App

#### Initialize Your Project

- First, make sure you have `node.js` installed on your machine.
- Run the following commands to initialize the project manually:

```bash
mkdir react-tabs-project
cd react-tabs-project
npm init -y
```

1. Create Components

- App.js: This is the main component responsible for fetching data and rendering other components.
- JobInfo.js: This component is responsible for displaying the details of the selected job.
- ButtonContainer.js: This component contains buttons representing each company that allow toggling between job details.
- Duties.js: This component lists out the duties of the selected job.

2. Fetch Data from API
   In App.js, fetch the job data using the fetch API inside the useEffect hook. Set the fetched data into a state variable jobs, and manage the loading state with loading:
   [API URL](https://www.course-api.com/react-tabs-project);

```javascript
const fetchJobs = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const jobsData = await response.json();
  setJobs(jobsData);
  setLoading(false);
};
useEffect(() => {
  fetchJobs();
}, []);
```

3. Handle Loading State
   To ensure data is fully fetched before rendering, use a loading spinner when the app is fetching data:

```javascript
if (loading) {
  return (
    <section className="jobs-center">
      <div className="loading"></div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

4. Implement Dynamic Tabs
   Use the ButtonContainer component to toggle between different companies:

```javascript
<ButtonContainer
  jobs={jobs}
  currentItem={currentItem}
  setCurrentItem={setCurrentItem}
/>
```

The JobInfo component is used to display the respective job information:

```javascript
<JobInfo jobs={jobs} currentItem={currentItem} />
```

## Why Use a Spinner for Data Fetching

In this project, we use a loading spinner as middleware to ensure that the data is fully fetched before rendering the main content. This is important because React initially renders components before useEffect (which contains the data fetching logic) has finished retrieving data. The spinner acts as a visual cue for the user that something is happening in the background, which improves the user experience by preventing an empty or broken UI during the data retrieval process.

By setting up the spinner inside the loading state, the app ensures:

- Better UX: Users see a loading animation while waiting for the data.
- Prevent Errors: The app doesn't attempt to render content from an empty or undefined state, which could lead to runtime errors.

## Algorithm Explanation

Algorithm for Fetching and Displaying Job Info

1. Initialize State:

- loading = true: Indicates that the data is being fetched.
- jobs = []: Will hold the fetched job data.
- currentItem = 0: Keeps track of the currently selected job (defaults to the first job).

2. Fetch Data:

- The fetchJobs function is invoked inside useEffect.
- Fetches job data from the external API.
- Sets the jobs state with the fetched data and sets loading = false.

3. Render UI:

- If loading = true, render the loading spinner.
- If loading = false, render the job buttons (company names) and the job info.
- The user can click on a company name to update currentItem and show the respective job information.

4. Event Handling:

- Each button in ButtonContainer updates the currentItem state.
- When currentItem changes, the JobInfo component displays the new job details.

5. UI Update:

- The app re-renders the job info each time the user clicks a different company name.
